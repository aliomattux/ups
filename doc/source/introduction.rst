This section provides an overview of Shipping Services. It describes the 
services available through the Shipping API, and it explains—at an overview 
level—how the APIs operate.

What Shipping Services Can Do
-----------------------------

The Shipping API makes UPS shipping services available to client applications 
that communicate with UPS using the Internet. With this API, applications can 
prepare or schedule small package shipments, manage returns, or cancel 
previously scheduled shipments.

Shipments
    Shipping Services give your applications many ways to manage the shipment 
    of small packages to their destination. UPS offers a range of delivery time 
    frames from same day to standard ground transportation. Shipments may be 
    within the United States or international, and they may range from letter 
    documents to large packages. (Note: for freight services, please refer to 
    the APIs designed for freight services.)
    
    UPS also supports many valued added services for shipments, including 
    collect on delivery (COD), declared value, delivery confirmation, and 
    automatic notification of delivery status.

    For full details on all UPS shipping services, please consult the latest 
    UPS Rate and Service Guide available at http://www.ups.com. Note that these 
    shipments are sometimes called forward shipments or outbound shipments to 
    distinguish them from returns.
